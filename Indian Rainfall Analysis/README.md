# Indian Rainfall Analysis and Prediction
Indian Government has undertaken many research studies to analyze the impact of global warming and climate change on rainfall pattern in India. The analyses were made using observed rainfall data from more than 3000 rain-gauge stations spread over the country for 115 years (1901-2015). The major inferences from these studies based on the 115 years of rainfall data are as follows:

The analysis of 115 years of monsoon rainfall data suggests that there is no long term change or trend in the monsoon rainfall averaged over the country. Even though, there are no changes in the all-India rainfall, there are significant changes in annual rainfall in some meteorological sub-divisions. Rainfall over Kerala, East Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura (NMMT) show decreasing trends. However, rainfall over coastal Karnataka, Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir show an increasing trend.

<br>There is a general tendency of increasing frequency of extreme rainfall (heavy rainfall events) over India, especially over the central parts of India during the southwest (June- September) monsoon season. There is no evidence of global warming on the observed changes in annual or seasonal rainfall over India. However, there is growing evidence suggesting that increasing frequency of extreme rainfall is due to global warming. The climate change assessment made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that in future, frequency of extreme rainfall may increase over India due to increase in global warming. However, there are NO other long term changes/trends in rainfall over India which can be attributed to global warming. The Indian Monsoon is found to be a stable system.

With this data with more variations of average rainfall, it is very difficult for a statistical model to predict the required data point.Here we implement neural networks and polynomial regression to predict the avg rainfall, the neural net is used to create multiple features that helps in predicting the data points with more seasonal variations

### Steps involved in the project.<br>

### Reading the dataset using pandas.<br>

### Plotting various graphs using matplotlib and seaborn based on the dataset for data analysis.<br>

### Choosing the avg_rainfall column to train the model on the year and every month data.

### Sorting the dataset based on the avg_rainfall.<br>

### Performing data analysis.<br>

### Scaling the data.<br>

### Dividing the dataset into training and testing data.<br>

### Similarly performing EDA on the second dataset.<br>

### Plotting the average rainfall values of the first dataset on the map of India for better data visualization.<br>

### Training the model using neural networks and polynomial regression and neural net is used to create multiple features.<br>

### The model achieved and accuracy of 98.866 using polynomial regression.<br>

### Predicting the results of the model after 2015 for a particular state chosen by the user.<br>

### Plotting the graph between the real values and the predicted values.<br>

### Saving the model.
